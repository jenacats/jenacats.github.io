									<h1>Minhvy Jena Van</h1>
                                    <p>Hi! I'm a Software Engineer with a BS of Computer Science from George Mason University. I have previously worked at Rebellion Defense, George Mason University, and Kensho Technologies. In my free-time I do Olympic Weightlifting and run an <a href="https://jenacats.github.io/jena_png.github.io/" target="_blank">art business </a>.

									In Fall 2022, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant under Professor Bo Han. 
									We were creating a machine learning model for foveated rendering to be used with augmented reality 
									and virtual reality. Foveated rendering significantly reduced the bits needed to be sent by lowering 
									the quality of the object or volumetric video where the user was not looking. By using eye tracking, 
									the points where the user was looking were high quality, while the other parts were low quality. 
									I conducted experiments utilizing Microsoft Hololens augmented reality headsets to discover 
									optimal rendering values.

									In the Summer of 2022, I interned at Rebellion Defense and created a virtual
                                    road network in order to then predict object movement along the roads. Such objects could be 
                                    a car or a truck. The origin of this project was in response to the Ukraine and Russia
                                    conflict in early 2022. This application could be used for predicting tank
                                    movement and evacuate citizens from predicted areas.
                                    For this project, I utilized PostgreSQL and Open Street Maps. In order to 
                                    predict object movement, I decided to utilize a Monte Carlo method which uses 
                                    meta data like speed limit and total number of roads.

									In the Summer of 2020, I interned at Kensho Technologies and built a 
                                    natural language processing Google Chrome extension called WikiWhatsThis. 
                                    WikiWhatsThis is a Google Chrome extension that receives input from a large body of text and returns
                                    relevant Wikipedia articles to lead readers to more context of online articles.
                                    This Google Chrome extension was created in order to combat news articles
                                    which usually provide narrow information about developing stories. For this project, 
                                    I evaluated various natural language processing algorithms to analyze the most efficient algorithm for this
                                    project. The final model was an explicit topic model using BM25 instead
                                    of TF-IDF.
